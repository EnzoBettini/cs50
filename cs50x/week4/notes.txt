r - read
w - write
rb - read binary
wb - write binary

fread -> reads file data
fwrite -> writes data into a file

fread(buffer_storage, size_of_block, hoe_many_blocks, input) -> fread(buffer, 1, 4, input) - read 4 blocks of 1 byte

fwrite(buffer_storage, size_of_block, hoe_many_blocks, input) -> fwrite(buffer, 1, 4, output) - writes 4 blocks of 1 byte
